Introduction

Methods

The implementation utilized several standard C libraries including stdlib.h,
stdio.h, sys/time.h, time.h, limits.h, and stdbool.h. 
All measurements were conducted on an Intel i7-13700K CPU at default frequency set-
tings. 
The code was compiled using GCC without optimization flags (-O0) to ensure consistent baseline performance measurements.
Code from previous labs have been used to generat erandom array and do the benchmark.
The benchmark methodology includes random generation of array elements.
Multiple iterations to obtain reliable average measurements, and time measurements
in nanoseconds using clock gettime().
All sort procedures have been tested by a check sorted procedure which go through all elements in the array and check if the privoius item is larger than the element after.
